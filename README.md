# Advent of Code

These are my submissions for advent of code.

Playing around with some different programming languages to get some more practice in different languages. Mostly Rust, at the moment, although as I more comfortable in that I'll consider other options and ways to explore stuff while problem solving.

Working on 2019 and 2020 as they come out at the moment.
